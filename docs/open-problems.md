# Open Problems (ZAR Context)

- **Oracle quality for ZAR/USD:** Market hours & fragmented venues complicate robust feeds.
- **LVR vs. Dynamic Fees:** No perfect mitigation; dynamic fees improve outcomes but require careful tuning.
- **Yield Integration:** ZAR has higher rates vs USD; LP rewards should reflect local carry without breaking peg mechanics.
- **Regulatory & FX Controls:** On/off-ramp and hedging permissions differ by venue; operational setup matters.
- **Flow Asymmetry:** One-sided demand (e.g., USD-bound flows) can drain inventoryâ€”inventory caps + periodic hedging needed.
